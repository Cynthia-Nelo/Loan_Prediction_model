# Loan Application Prediction Model
##Overview:
This project focuses on developing a classification model to predict whether a loan application will be approved or rejected based on various input features. The goal is to accurately predict loan outcomes using machine learning algorithms.

## Models Used
 1. Logistic Regression:
A linear model used to predict the loan status based on input features such as loan interest rate, applicant's income, and loan amount.
Simple yet effective for modeling the relationship between the features and the target variable.

 3. Support Vector Classifier (SVC):
A more advanced model that can capture non-linear relationships by finding the optimal hyperplane to separate loan approvals from rejections.
Offers better performance in more complex scenarios where the relationship between the features and target is not linear.

## Objective
The aim is to combine the strengths of both models—Logistic Regression's simplicity and interpretability with SVC's ability to handle non-linear patterns—so as to improve prediction accuracy and robustness.

## Evaluation
The models were evaluated using:
Accuracy,
Precision,
Recall,
Classification Report.
These metrics ensure that the model's predictions are reliable and robust, providing a solid basis for predicting loan approval outcomes.

## Conclusion
By leveraging Logistic Regression and Support Vector Classifier together, this project achieves a comprehensive approach to loan approval prediction, enhancing model performance and making it suitable for practical use in decision-making processes.
